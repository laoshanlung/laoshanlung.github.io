title: About me
---

I am a full-stack web developer from Vietnam. I am currently taking my Master's Programme in Computer Engineering/Software Engineering at Ã…bo Akademi University, Turku, Finland. I am interested in programming language (as long as it works in *nix system) and application architecture.

I mostly work with Javascript (both client-side and server-side). For client-side, I am using jquery, backbone, marionette and requirejs to build the UI (with some help from bootstrap). 

For server-side, I use nodejs with express as the main web framework and faye as the publish-subscribe messaging system. Apart from Javascript, I can also work with PHP (Yii) and Python (Flask).

In addition to the "code" side, I am able to do a simple server setup for production with HAProxy, Nginx, PgBouncer and several other tools (manually or through saltstack). Although I am not a full-fledged system admin, I am comfortable with server setup and management and I am willing to dive deep into it when necessary
